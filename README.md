# E-voting system

## Project idea

This is an e-voting system, an universal safe program that will allow us to create and start voting sessions independent on subjects and more conditions. 
This application could be used by any companies, groups of interests or for academic purposes. 
The main technology that will validate and monitor the voting process will be the blockchain technology. Collected data about a vote session will be distributive, what means that copies of data will be shared across multiple servers (at least we will try to simulate it) what will make hard to attack the system and modify someoneâ€™s vote, as the system will validate the chain comparing to all existing copies. 

## Scope

The scope of this project is to provide a software solution for an easier and a more secured way of voting process, the electronical one. This means that the voter can give his/her option remotely, and to be sure that his vote is confident and couldn't be modified by anyone.

## Current progress
At the moment project has 2 modules: Frontend and Backend. 
The Backend module has the most basic business logic implemented. The Frontend module has done the Home page, Log In page and partially the Admin module.
## To Do
For the backend must be implemented the blockchain algorithm, implement business logic for voters and candidates, implement business logic for polls and surveys.
For the Frontend must be implemented the module for each type of user, the business logic for voting process, statistics.
