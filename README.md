# E-voting system

## Project idea

This is an e-voting system, an universal safe program that will allow us to create and start voting sessions independent on subjects and more conditions. 
This application could be used by any companies, groups of interests or for academic purposes. 
The main technology that will validate and monitor the voting process will be the blockchain technology. Collected data about a vote session will be distributive, what means that copies of data will be shared across multiple servers (at least we will try to simulate it) what will make hard to attack the system and modify someoneâ€™s vote, as the system will validate the chain comparing to all existing copies. 

## Scope

The purposed scope is to provide a software solution for a easier and a more secured way of voting, the electronical one.
